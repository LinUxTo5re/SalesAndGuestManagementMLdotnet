# Guest Projection Using Machine Learning in C#(ML.NET) <br>
Welcome to the Sales And Guest Projection project repository! <br>
- Explore the Sales And Guest Projection repository, utilizing ML.NET, C#, MVVM, Microsoft SQL Server, and WPF. <br>
- Predict future guest using advanced tech - historical data fuels projections for upcoming days. <br>
- Tap into past actual and projected guest for accurate guest forecasts, a powerful business tool. <br>
- same logic can be applied for future sales projections using machine learning with the help of ML.NET
     <br>

## Columns Definition

- **Time** : column used to describe timestamp for guest count
- **Guest Count** : It's an actual guest count for specified timestamp
- **Projectd MyStore** : projectd guest count by using Average algorithm in existing application
- **Projected ML** : projectd guest count using machine learning (ML.NET)
- **Difference ML** : **Guest Count - Projected ML**
- **Difference SDM** : **Guest Count - Projected MyStore**
-    
## Technologies Used

- ML.NET
- C#
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Microsoft SQL Server Management
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project in Visual Studio:

### Requirements

- Visual Studio (Any version is compatible)     <br>

- Microsoft SQL Server     <br>

- .NET 5.0 (preferred)     <br>

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open Microsoft SQL Server and set up a database. Execute the stored procedure provided in the `ML_POC.sql` file.
3. You'll not have an access of our database, so It's recommended to create your own Sql/NoSql database and modify code and queries according your need.
4. Unzip or open the downloaded folder and double-click on `HourlySalesReport.sln` to open the project in Visual Studio.
5. Make a configuration adjustment: Search for `settings.settings` in the Solution Explorer's search bar and open `settings.settings`.
6. In the `settings.settings` page, locate the `data source` setting and update it with your server's name as demonstrated in `screenshot-3`. Save the changes and close the `settings.settings` page.
7. Click the "Start" button in Visual Studio to run the application.
