# Guest and Sales Projection Using Machine Learning in C# (ML.NET)

Welcome to the Sales and Guest Projection project repository!

- Explore the Sales and Guest Projection repository, utilizing ML.NET, C#, MVVM, Microsoft SQL Server, and WPF.
- Predict future guests using advanced tech - historical data fuels projections for upcoming days.
- Tap into past actual and projected guests for accurate guest forecasts; a powerful business tool.
- The same logic can be applied for future sales projections using machine learning with the help of ML.NET.

## Columns Definition
- **Time**: Column used to describe the timestamp for guest count.
- **Guest Count**: Actual guest count for the specified timestamp.
- **Projected MyStore**: Projected guest count using the Average algorithm in the existing application.
- **Projected ML**: Projected guest count using machine learning (ML.NET).
- **Difference ML**: Guest Count - Projected ML.
- **Difference SDM**: Guest Count - Projected MyStore.

## Technologies Used
- ML.NET
- C#
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Microsoft SQL Server Management
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project in Visual Studio:

### Requirements
- Visual Studio (Any version is compatible)
- Microsoft SQL Server
- .NET 5.0 (preferred)

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open Microsoft SQL Server and set up a database. Execute the stored procedure provided in the `ML_POC.sql` file.
3. If you don't have access to our database, it's recommended to create your own SQL/NoSQL database and modify the code and queries according to your needs.
4. Unzip or open the downloaded folder and double-click on `HourlySalesReport.sln` to open the project in Visual Studio.
5. Make a configuration adjustment: Search for `settings.settings` in the Solution Explorer's search bar and open `settings.settings`.
6. In the `settings.settings` page, locate the `data source` setting and update it with your server's name as demonstrated in `Screenshot-3`. Save the changes and close the `settings.settings` page.
7. Click the "Start" button in Visual Studio to run the application.
